If you're working through this as part of a team-based exercise, ensure you make progress at a good pace ensuring you understand perfectly what you are doing. It's not a race nor a competition.

> **Hint**: If you get stuck, you can ask for help from the proctors. You may also choose to peek at the solutions but **the idea of the lab is for you to search a little bit by yourself**.

### Build

In this first part, you are going to dockerize an application and publish your container image in a registry.

### Deployment

In the next part, you are going to deploy your application in a running cluster.

### Security

You will implement some DevSecOps principles by scanning your files and you will learn how to securely access resources outside of the cluster.

### Autoscaling

You will implement autoscaling and simulate high load on your application.
