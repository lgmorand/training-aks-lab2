If you're working through this as part of a team-based exercise, ensure you make progress at a good pace by dividing the workload between team members when possible. This may require work that might be needed in a later task.

> **Hint**: If you get stuck, you can ask for help from the proctors. You may also choose to peek at the solutions but **the idea of the lab is for you to look a little bit by yourself**.

### Build

Running through this as part of a half-day workshop, you should be able to complete the **Getting up and running** section. This involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the application container from Azure Container Registry, and setting up monitoring.
