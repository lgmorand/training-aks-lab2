If you're working through this as part of a team-based exercise, ensure you make progress at a good pace ensuring you perfectly understand what you are doing. It's not a race nor a competition.

> **Hint**: If you get stuck, you can ask for help from the proctors. You may also choose to peek at the solutions but **the idea of the lab is for you to look a little bit by yourself**.
