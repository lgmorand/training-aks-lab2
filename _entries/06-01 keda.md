title: Scaling with Keda
parent-id: autoscaling

As your app becomes more popular, you'll need to scale it to handle the increased load. In AKS, you can scale your app by increasing the number of replicas in your deployment. The Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) will automatically scale your app based on CPU and/or memory utilization. But not all workloads rely on these metrics for scaling. If say, you need to scale your workload based on the number of items in a queue, HPA will not be sufficient.

This is where we take a different approach and deploy KEDA to scale our app. [KEDA is a Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler](https://keda.sh/). It allows you to scale your app on basically any metric. If there is a metric that KEDA can can access to, it can scale based on it. Under the covers KEDA, looks at the metrics and your scaling rules and eventually creates a HPA to do the actual scaling.

The AKS add-on for KEDA has already been installed in your cluster.

> Note: out-of-the box, with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), kubernetes is [already capable of autoscaling your application based on CPU or Memory](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) and can even be based on custom metrics. Nevertheless, it's limited and that's why you are going to use Keda whom capabilities (with scalers) is almost unlimited.

### Setting request and limits

When scaling on a performance metric, we need to let Kubernetes know how much compute and memory resources to allocate for each pod. We do this by setting the `requests` and `limits` in our deployment. The `requests` are the minimum amount of resources that Kubernetes will allocate for each pod. The `limits` are the maximum amount of resources that Kubernetes will allocate for each pod. Kubernetes will use these values to determine how many pods to run based on the amount of resources available on the nodes in the cluster.

Open the `azure-voting-app-deployment.yaml` file, find the empty `resources: {}` block and replace it with the following.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 4m
    memory: 55Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 6m
    memory: 75Mi
```

Setting resource requests and limits is a best practice and should be done for all your deployments.

Your `azure-voting-app-deployment.yaml` file should now look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: azure-voting-db
  name: azure-voting-db
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: azure-voting-db
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: azure-voting-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: postgres
          name: postgres
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 4m
              memory: 55Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 6m
              memory: 75Mi
          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_USER_FILE
              value: "/mnt/secrets-store/database-user"
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE
              value: "/mnt/secrets-store/database-password"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: azure-voting-db-secrets
              mountPath: "/mnt/secrets-store"
              readOnly: true
            - name: azure-voting-db-data
              mountPath: "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
              subPath: "data"
      serviceAccountName: azure-voting-app-serviceaccount
      volumes:
        - name: azure-voting-db-secrets
          csi:
            driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
            readOnly: true
            volumeAttributes:
              secretProviderClass: azure-keyvault-secrets
        - name: azure-voting-db-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: pvc-azuredisk

status: {}
```

When your deployment manifest is fully configured, run your deployment pipeline.

### Scaling with KEDA based on CPU utilization

Create a new `azure-voting-app-scaledobject.yaml` manifest for KEDA. Here we will scale the application up when the CPU utilization is greater than 50%. Don't forget to [read the documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/2.12/scalers/cpu/)

{% collapsible %}

```yaml
cat <<EOF > azure-voting-app-scaledobject.yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: azure-voting-app-scaledobject
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: azure-voting-app
  triggers:
    - type: cpu
      metricType: Utilization
      metadata:
        value: "50"
EOF
```

The default values for minimum and maximum replica counts weren't included in our manifest above, but it will default to 0 and 100 respectively. In some cases, the minimum defaults to 1 so consult the documentation for the specific scaler you are using.
Apply the manifest to create the ScaledObject.

{% endcollapsible %}

Apply your manifest to your cluster

Run the following command to ensure the ScaledObject was created.

```bash
kubectl get scaledobject
```

Wait until the `READY` column shows `True`

```text
NAME                            SCALETARGETKIND      SCALETARGETNAME    MIN   MAX   TRIGGERS   AUTHENTICATION   READY   ACTIVE   FALLBACK   AGE
azure-voting-app-scaledobject   apps/v1.Deployment   azure-voting-app               cpu                         True    True     Unknown    16s
```
