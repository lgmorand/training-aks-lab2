Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes Workshop n°1. In this lab, you'll go through tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy a containerized application to Kubernetes on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).

You can use this guide as a Kubernetes tutorial and as study material to help you get started learning Kubernetes.

Some things you’ll be going through:

- Create Kubernetes cluster
- Deploying the app to AKS and accessing it publicly
- Monitoring the app with Azure Monitor

The lab will also include optional sections to dive deeper into the following topics:

<!-- - Deploying multiple microservices -->
<!-- - Application performance monitoring -->
<!-- - Entreprise governance -->
- Detecting cost optimization opportunities
- Handling load spikes
<!-- - Resilience -->
<!-- - Using managed identities to connect to other Azure Services -->
<!-- - Easy deployments with Helm -->
